# DNA--Sequence-prediction
Welcome to this project, where we explore the fascinating world of DNA sequence prediction! We've built a computational framework to predict DNA sequences based on a unique dataset containing human, dog, and chimpanzee genomes. This project delves into the intricate patterns within these genomes and aims to answer questions like:

Can we accurately predict DNA sequences for each species based on their evolutionary relationships?
What are the key features that differentiate these sequences across species?
Can our predictions shed light on the shared ancestry and unique characteristics of these organisms?
Project Highlights:

Data: We utilize a curated dataset of human, dog, and chimpanzee DNA sequences, ensuring high-quality data for model training and evaluation.
Machine Learning Approach: Our framework employs advanced machine learning techniques, potentially including deep learning models, to capture complex relationships within the DNA sequences.
Prediction Performance: We rigorously evaluate our model's accuracy in predicting DNA sequences for each species, analyzing its strengths and limitations.
Visualization and Analysis: We present our findings in a clear and concise manner, utilizing interactive visualizations and compelling data analysis to showcase our insights.
Project Goals:

Develop a robust and accurate DNA sequence prediction model for human, dog, and chimpanzee genomes.
Identify and analyze key features that distinguish the DNA sequences of these three species.
Contribute to the understanding of evolutionary relationships and species-specific adaptations through DNA analysis.
